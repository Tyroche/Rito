# Rito
A brief foray investigating the Riot Games API during the 2nd URF challenge.

I'm looking to investigate the relationships between my two favorite AP items -- Rylai's and Liandry's -- and see what has changed 
over the course of the patches.  This isn't meant to be comprehensive or mind-blowing, but mostly a personal interest and excersice.

Ideally it will culminate in a functional webpage at some point -- whether or I can get there by the deadline of the 31st is another issue entirely :)
